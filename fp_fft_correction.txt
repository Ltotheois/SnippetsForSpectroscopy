Top plot are the fft-coefficients.
Beneath is a triplet of plots, with the first being the original spectrum,
second the baseline that is substracted and third the resulting spectrum.
On the bottom is a slider to change the cut-off frequency for the fft,
but alternatively you can also click in the fft-coefficients plot or use
the arrow keys and shift to change the cut-off frequency.

If a matching info file is given, the duration of the fit is calculated correctly,
otherwise it is set to 30 seconds.

You can select multiple plots in the file selection window, press enter or space
to save the changes for a file and go to the next file, press esc to skip it,
press ctrl+q to close the app. Press ctrl+left to go to the previous file without
saving.
