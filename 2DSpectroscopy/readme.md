# 2D-Spectroscopy

2D-spectroscopy tunes the probe and pump frequency, resulting, together with the intensity, in three dimensions. To showcase the 2D-spectroscopy in all its glory, *2Dspectroscopy.py* can be used to generate an interactive 3D figure of 2D-spectrum data. Please be aware, that currently the pump-frequency is extracted from the filename, therefore one might have to change row 32 if the filename is in a different format.

*2Dlive.html* is a live presentation of how a 2D spectrum is recorded and can be opened with every modern browser. Just press any key to start the show.
