# Signal Simulation

These scripts simulate the signal of a 2F-demodulated absorption experiment.
The settings are found at top of the scripts in the settings dictionary.

animation.py in the Conventional or DMDR folder allows to choose between the simulation of a classic experiment (settings["DR"] = False) and a double resonance experiment (settings["DR"] = True).

animation_drdm.py in the DMDR folder shows the Double Modulation Double Resonance (DR-DR) case in greater detail.

FMAmplitude.py in the FMAmplitude folder shows the case of a too small, a good and a too big modulation amplitude. Additionally the 1f-case is depicted.
