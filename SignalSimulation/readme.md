# Signal Simulation

These scripts simulate the signal of a 2F-demodulated absorption experiment.
The settings are found at top of the scripts in the settings dictionary.

animation.py allows to choose between the simulation of a classic experiment (settings["DR"] = False)
and a double resonance experiment (settings["DR"] = True).

animation_drdm.py shows the Double Modulation Double Resonance (DR-DR) case in greater detail.
